# Tank calibration by laser scanning

Software for processing laser scan point clouds of vertical steel tanks
and generating calibration tables according to:

- GOST 8.570-2000
- GOST R 8.996-2020

## Project goals
- Processing point clouds from laser scanning
- Reconstruction of a 3D geometric model of the tank
- Calculation of geometric parameters
- Volume calculation and calibration table generation

## Input data
- Point cloud (XYZ)

## Output data
- Calibration table (volume vs level)
- Geometric parameters of the tank

## Project status
🚧 Work in progress
